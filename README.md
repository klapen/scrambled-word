# English spelling exercises

This project is a game to practice English spelling and listening.

The audio will present you with the English word pronunciation to guess. In the second row (gray), you will find a pool of scrambled from that word's spelling.

Just move each letter to the first row (white) in the correct place. If you want to start again, just click on the Reset button.

After you finish, you can submit your answer to check the spelling. Just keep in mind that all the letters in the grey row will be consider as wrong. To get a new word, just click the Next word button.

Enjoy playing!!
